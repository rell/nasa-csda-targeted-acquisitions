Archived targeted acquisitioning project. This project is my data extraction pipeline I wrote as part of my 2022 Summer NASA Internship with the (CSDA) Program at NASA. 

The purpose of this project is to proactively purchase and hold found areas of interest based off real time events and on going topics  within scientific journals and research columns. These sites are then scraped and processed via a Natural Language Processor (NLP) for key words that associate a location with an event. This event is then declared an AOI, proactively purchased and sent to an event database for holding and further research. For a more detailed overview refer to the following <a href="https://github.com/rell/nasa-csda-targeted-acquisitions/blob/main/ORIGINAL_rdme.md">page</a>. 

The following code is incomplete and features what was worked on during my time in the project.
